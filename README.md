## 💡 How It Works

### Adding Tasks

Tasks are pushed into a `todos` array and stored in `localStorage` as a JSON string.

### Rendering

Each task is dynamically rendered in the DOM with a unique `data-key` (generated using `Date.now()`).

### Persistence

On page load, `getFromLocalStorage()` restores saved tasks automatically.

### Offline Support

The Service Worker caches:

* `index.html`
* CSS files
* JS files
* Manifest

This allows the app to function even without internet.
